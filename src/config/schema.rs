//! TOML schema for `comply.toml`.
//!
//! Two-section structure:
//!
//! - `[rules.<rule-id>]` — per-rule overrides applied to every file
//!     - `disabled = true` — skip the rule entirely
//!     - `<threshold-key> = <value>` — rule-specific knobs (max, min, etc.)
//!
//! - `[overrides."<glob>"]` — per-path overrides matched against the
//!   diagnostic's file path. Repeat for as many globs as needed.
//!     - `disable = ["rule-id-1", "rule-id-2"]` — silence these rules
//!       when the file matches the glob
//!     - Threshold overrides per rule are not supported in v2.6 — they
//!       collapse to global defaults inside the rule's check, since the
//!       check runs once per file before we know its glob bucket.
//!
//! Defaults are kept in `super::defaults` and merged into the user's
//! config at load time, so a user file with `[rules.max-function-lines]
//! max = 60` only changes that one knob, not the rest.
